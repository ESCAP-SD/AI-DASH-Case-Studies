5-ai-powered-chatbot-for-official-website-of-nso-india,AI-powered Chatbot for official website of NSO India,"NSO, India",National Statistical Office,2025,Data dissemination / communication,Disseminate,Generative AI / LLMs,Llama 3.2 3B,"Dissemination / communication: Supporting the presentation, explanation, or communication of statistics (e.g. generating statistical releases, narratives, data visualisations, metadata, or user-facing summaries);",With private sector partner/vendor;,NA,Production (operational): The AI application is integrated into routine statistical operations and is used on a regular basis to support official statistics,"The official website of NSO, India (www.mospi.gov.in) is an important public interface and digital face of NSO India, which serves as a comprehensive resource, offering access to various statistical surveys, programs, schemes, and initiatives. It also provides varied and crucial information related to MoSPI to its various stakeholders viz. news, events, publications, and data downloads, providing users with detailed information on macroeconomic aggregates, state domestic products, GDP, and more.
The website hosts a large volume of data and information on various statistical products spread across sections of the website and across multiple formats (text, PDFs, Excel etc.). However, a user needs to know in which relevant section/ product to look into, for accessing relevant information. For example, to know employment/ unemployment rate for any State/UT or sector, the user needs to go to the PLFS reports page, about which he may not be aware. This makes it more difficult for users, especially those not well-versed in statistics, in quickly accessing relevant information, datasets, reports, and statistical documents and interpret required information. This often leads to increased dependency on manual support, delays in information retrieval, and reduced user satisfaction.","This chatbot delivers intelligent and contextual responses to user queries, ensuring relevant and accurate information retrieval, leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI.","The AI-powered chatbot has led to improved accessibility by enabling faster and simpler retrieval of datasets, reports, and statistical content without requiring deep navigation.","The Chatbot required training on data stored in different formats like pdfs, scanned pdfs, etc. Hence, significant effort was needed in preprocessing the documents to make them AI-ready. Since it is a chatbot for the Government, utmost care was needed and proper guardrailing was done to ensure that the chatbot responded only on the information available on the website and does not add any opinion or any information outside the scope of NSO, India website. 
",No,Documentation of model and limitations;Risk or ethics assessment;Human-in-the-loop oversight;Data protection / confidentiality procedures;,"The NSO India website chatbot utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a framework that ensures high accuracy by pulling information directly from official reports, publications and press releases. To guarantee reliability, the system underwent rigorous testing to ensure it provides factual data without including personal opinions. Additionally, the chatbot is evaluated to ensure its responses are ethical, unbiased, and fair. Every response during evaluation phase is cross-checked against original publications to maintain accountability and ensure information remains consistent with content of the NSO India website.",The Chatbot can be accessed at https://www.mospi.gov.in/; the GitHub link may be accessed at https://github.com/nso-india/mospi-llm-chatbot-v1.

Prompt‑injection checks run before any model use.,"Faster turnaround of analysis, with usable first‑cut insights. Scales well to higher submission volumes without adding equivalent analyst workload. Reusable pattern emerging for future submission analyses across other surveys.","Challenges: not well defined business processes, immature governance processes, and low levels of trust in AI outputs.

In Vanuatu, data on cyclones, droughts, floods, and slow-onset climate impacts existed across multiple agencies, but there was no unified system to analyse this information and trigger preparedness, response, or financing decisions. This resulted in delayed assessments, fragmented coordination, and reactive responses that increased losses for vulnerable populations. The initiative addresses this gap by creating a national, AI-enabled loss and damage decision system that links climate risk indicators to causal impact models, operational thresholds, and trigger-based decision processes for anticipatory action, response, and recovery.","AI and machine learning are used to analyse satellite imagery and environmental data to generate real-time indicators of climate change and disaster impacts, such as land cover, flooding, soil health, coastal erosion, and temperature trends. These indicators are integrated with census and administrative data through automated analytical pipelines to estimate exposure, damage, resource needs, and financial losses. The outputs feed into a national management information system that supports trigger-based decisions for anticipatory action, emergency response, and recovery financing.","- Rapid estimation of disaster impacts and resource needs through automated analytical pipelines. 
- Integration of machine learning outputs, census data, and administrative data into a single national decision platform. 
- Improved timeliness and consistency of impact assessments across sectors. 
- Enhanced coordination across ministries and disaster response clusters through a centralised system. 
- Strengthened local capacity in geospatial analysis, machine learning, and reproducible analytical pipelines. 
- Land classification model achieved approximately 82% accuracy, enabling reliable environmental monitoring.","- Fragmented legacy data systems and inconsistent data quality across sectors. 
- Limited technical capacity for machine learning, remote sensing, and open-source analytical tools. 
- Need for extensive data cleaning, harmonisation, and interoperability between systems. 
- Institutional coordination challenges across ministries and stakeholders. 
- Requirement for human-in-the-loop validation to ensure ethical use and accurate interpretation of AI-derived indicators.

Special attention is given to the representation of vulnerable groups through the integration of census and administrative data, including gender and protection indicators. Data governance protocols, role-based access controls, and ethical data-sharing agreements are applied to protect sensitive information. The system is designed to support decision-making rather than replace it, with final actions determined through established government coordination and accountability mechanisms.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnVGynI0fhk&t=6s
